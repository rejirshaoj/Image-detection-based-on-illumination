# Image-detection-based-on-illumination
Incomplete detection, obtaining the position of the light source through clustering and sift feature point extraction. 
In the folder picture, save the image you want to detect. Run save_name.py, which preprocesses images to folder picture_new. 
Then run save_picture.py, which determines whether it is a point light source or a line light source based on the brightness of the image. 
Finally run sift.py, which generates images of feature point extraction and light source location.
